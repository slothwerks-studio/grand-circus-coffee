# Grand Circus Coffee
## A coffee shop ordering app designed for tablet

### What is this?

No, this is not a fully operational coffee shop application with [Square payment integration](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/payment-api).  Rather, this is a simple web app built with plain ol' HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  This repo serves as an extension to the existing [Grand Circus Intro to Code Workshop](https://www.grandcircus.co/itc-remote) with its [initial codebase](https://www.grandcircus.co/itc-practice-remote) from Codepen.

If you have already used the [student guide](https://www.grandcircus.co/itc-guide) to complete the web application... awesome!  This repo adds new layers of complexity to the initial project, introducing additional concepts such as:

* [Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)
* [Templated String Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
* DOM Manipulation with [innerHTML](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp)

### How does it work?

The Grand Circus Coffee shop serves three items.  This app stores the price and quantity for those items in an object.  The default value for the quantity is zero; item quantities are updated using a checkout form.  Once the customer order is complete, one may acquire a receipt with a breakdown of the items and a grand total.
